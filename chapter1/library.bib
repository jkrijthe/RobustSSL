@article{Kenward1997,
abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

abstract = {From training data from several related domains (or tasks), methods of domain adaptation try to combine knowledge to improve performance. This paper discusses an approach to domain adaptation which is inspired by a causal interpretation of the multi-task problem. We assume that a covariate shift assumption holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant with respect to shifts in those predictors (covariates). We propose to learn the corresponding conditional expectation in the training domains and use it for estimation in the target domain. We further introduce a method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset in regression and classification. We study the performance of this approach in an adversarial setting, in the case where no additional examples are available in the test domain. If a labeled sample is available, we provide a method for using both the transferred invariant conditional and task specific information. We present results on synthetic data sets and a sentiment analysis problem.},

We show, contrary to a widely held belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation - which is borne out in repeated experiments - that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

@article{Li2015b,
abstract = {The scarcity of data annotated at the desired level of granularity is a recurring issue in many applications. Significant amounts of effort have been devoted to developing weakly supervised methods tailored to each individual setting, which are often carefully designed to take advantage of the particular properties of weak supervision regimes, form of available data and prior knowledge of the task at hand. Unfortunately, it is difficult to adapt these methods to new tasks and/or forms of data, which often require different weak supervision regimes or models. We present a general-purpose method that can solve any weakly supervised learning problem irrespective of the weak supervision regime or the model. The proposed method turns any off-the-shelf strongly supervised classifier into a weakly supervised classifier and allows the user to specify any arbitrary weakly supervision regime via a loss function. We apply the method to several different weak supervision regimes and demonstrate competitive results compared to methods specifically engineered for those settings.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm which provides the one-dimensional subspace where the Bayes error is minimized for the C class problem with homoscedastic Gaussian distributions. Our main result shows that the set of possible one-dimensional spaces v, for which the order of the projected class means is identical, defines a convex region with associated convex Bayes error function g(v). This allows for the minimization of the error function using standard convex optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is then extended to the minimization of the Bayes error in the more general case of heteroscedastic distributions. This is done by means of an appropriate kernel mapping function. This result is further extended to obtain the d-dimensional solution for any given d, by iteratively applying our algorithm to the null space of the (d - 1)-dimensional solution. We also show how this result can be used to improve up on the outcomes provided by existing algorithms, and derive a low-computational cost, linear approximation. Extensive experimental validations are provided to demonstrate the use of these algorithms in classification, data analysis and visualization.},

abstract = {When applying hierarchical clustering algorithms to cluster patient samples from microarray data, the clustering patterns generated by most algorithms tend to be dominated by groups of highly differentially expressed genes that have closely related expression patterns. Sometimes, these genes may not be relevant to the biological process under study or their functions may already be known. The problem is that these genes can potentially drown out the effects of other genes that are relevant or have novel functions. We propose a procedure called complementary hierarchical clustering that is designed to uncover the structures arising from these novel genes that are not as highly expressed. Simulation studies show that the procedure is effective when applied to a variety of examples. We also define a concept called relative gene importance that can be used to identify the influential genes in a given clustering. Finally, we analyze a microarray data set from 295 breast cancer patients, using clustering with the correlation-based distance measure. The complementary clustering reveals a grouping of the patients which is uncorrelated with a number of known prognostic signatures and significantly differing distant metastasis-free probabilities.},

In this view, the difference between mean-field methods and belief propagation is not the amount of structure they model, but only the measure of loss they minimize (`exclusive' versus `inclusive' Kullback-Leibler divergence). In each case, message-passing arises by minimizing a localized version of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking, for example) and their suitability for different tasks. Furthermore, by considering a wider variety of divergence measures (such as alpha-divergences), we can achieve different complexity and performance goals.},

The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple for-mula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate.

abstract = {Modern massive datasets create a fundamental problem at the intersection of the computational and statistical sciences: how to provide guarantees on the quality of statistical inference given bounds on computational resources, such as time or space. Our approach to this problem is to define a notion of "algorithmic weakening," in which a hierarchy of algorithms is ordered by both computational efficiency and statistical efficiency, allowing the growing strength of the data at scale to be traded off against the need for sophisticated processing. We illustrate this approach in the setting of denoising problems, using convex relaxation as the core inferential tool. Hierarchies of convex relaxations have been widely used in theoretical computer science to yield tractable approximation algorithms to many computationally intractable tasks. In the current paper, we show how to endow such hierarchies with a statistical characterization and thereby obtain concrete tradeoffs relating algorithmic runtime to amount of data.},

abstract = {We unify f-divergences, Bregman divergences, surrogate loss bounds (regret bounds), proper scoring rules, matching losses, cost curves, ROC-curves and information. We do this by systematically studying integral and variational representations of these objects and in so doing identify their primitives which all are related to cost-sensitive binary classification. As well as clarifying relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate loss bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f-divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates Maximum Mean Discrepancy to Fisher Linear Discriminants. It also suggests new techniques for estimating f-divergences.},

@article{Witten2011,
abstract = {We consider the supervised classification setting, in which the data consist of p features measured on n observations, each of which belongs to one of K classes. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for this problem. However, in the high-dimensional setting where p ≫ n, LDA is not appropriate for two reasons. First, the standard estimate for the within-class covariance matrix is singular, and so the usual discriminant rule cannot be applied. Second, when p is large, it is difficult to interpret the classification rule obtained from LDA, since it involves all p features. We propose penalized LDA, a general approach for penalizing the discriminant vectors in Fisher's discriminant problem in a way that leads to greater interpretability. The discriminant problem is not convex, so we use a minorization-maximization approach in order to efficiently optimize it when convex penalties are applied to the discriminant vectors. In particular, we consider the use of L(1) and fused lasso penalties. Our proposal is equivalent to recasting Fisher's discriminant problem as a biconvex problem. We evaluate the performances of the resulting methods on a simulation study, and on three gene expression data sets. We also survey past methods for extending LDA to the high-dimensional setting, and explore their relationships with our proposal.},

abstract = {We propose and study properties of maximum likelihood estimators in the class of conditional transformation models. Based on a suitable explicit parameterisation of the unconditional or conditional transformation function, we establish a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models that can be estimated, compared and analysed in the maximum likelihood framework. Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable can be set-up and estimated in the same theoretical and computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterisation thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact full likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum likelihood-based estimation for conditional transformation models allowing the same flexibility as the theory developed here was employed to illustrate the wide range of possible applications.},

@article{Little1992,
abstract = {The literature of regression analysis with missing values of the independent variables is reviewed. Six classes of procedures are distinguished: complete case analysis, available case methods, least squares on imputed data, maximum likelihood, Bayesian methods, and multiple imputation. Methods are compared and illustrated when missing data are confined to one independent variable, and extensions to more general patterns are indicated. Attention is paid to the performance of methods when the missing data are not missing completely at random. Least squares methods that fill in missing X's using only data on the X's are contrasted with likelihood-based methods that use data on the X's and Y. The latter approach is preferred and provides methods for elaboration of the basic normal linear regression model. It is suggested that more widely distributed software is needed that advances beyond complete-case analysis, available-case analysis, and naive imputation methods. Bayesian simulation methods and multiple imputation are reviewed; these provide fruitful avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the hinge loss is used to construct support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The hinge loss is related to the shortest distance between sets and the corresponding classifier is hence sensitive to noise and unstable for re-sampling. In contrast, the pinball loss is related to the quantile distance and the result is less sensitive. The pinball loss has been deeply studied and widely applied in regression but it has not been used for classification. In this paper, we propose a SVM classifier with the pinball loss, called pin-SVM, and investigate its properties, including noise insensitivity, robustness, and misclassification error. Besides, insensitive zone is applied to the pin-SVM and a sparse model is obtained. Compared to the SVM with the hinge loss, the proposed pin-SVM has the same computational complexity and enjoys noise insensitivity and re-sampling stability.},

We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforce-ment learning.},

At first, a cohort comprised of tissue samples from six adenocarcinoma entities located at different organ sites (esophagus, breast, colon, liver, stomach, thyroid gland, n = 171) was classified using two algorithms for a training and test set. For the test set, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest yielded overall accuracies of 82.74 and 81.18{\%}, respectively. Then, colon cancer liver metastasis samples (n = 19) were introduced into the classification. The liver metastasis samples could be discriminated with high accuracy from primary tumors of colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, colon cancer liver metastasis samples could be successfully classified by using colon cancer primary tumor samples for the training of the classifier. These findings demonstrate that MALDI imaging-derived proteomic classifiers can discriminate between different tumor types at different organ sites and in the same site.},

abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian models can be especially useful in precision medicine settings, where clinicians are interested in estimating the patient-level latent variables associated with an individual's current health state and its trajectory. Such models are often fit using batch Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, the slow speed of batch MCMC computation makes it difficult to implement in clinical settings, where immediate latent variable estimates are often desired in response to new patient data. In this report, we discuss how importance sampling (IS) can instead be used to obtain fast, in-clinic estimates of patient-level latent variables. We apply IS to the hierarchical model proposed in Coley et al (2015) for predicting an individual's underlying prostate cancer state. We find that latent variable estimates via IS can typically be obtained in 1-10 seconds per person and have high agreement with estimates coming from longer-running batch MCMC methods. Alternative options for out-of-sample fitting and online updating are also discussed.},

abstract = {We describe and develop a close relationship between two problems that have customarily been regarded as distinct: that of maximizing entropy, and that of minimizing worst-case expected loss.  Using a formulation grounded in the equilibrium theory of zero-sum games between Decision Maker and Nature, these two problems are shown to be dual to each other, the solution to each providing that to the other.  Although Topsoe described this connection for the Shannon entropy over 20 years ago, it does not appear to be widely known even in that important special case. 

We here generalize this theory to apply to arbitrary decision problems and loss functions.  We indicate how an appropriate generalized definition of entropy can be associated with such a problem, and we show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the above-mentioned duality continues to apply in this extended context.  This simultaneously provides a possible rationale for maximizing entropy and a tool for finding robust Bayes acts.  We also describe the essential identity between the problem of maximizing entropy and that of minimizing a related discrepancy or divergence between distributions.  This leads to an extension, to arbitrary discrepancies, of a well-known minimax theorem for the case of Kullback-Leibler divergence (the "redundancy-capacity theorem'' of information theory).  For the important case of families of distributions having certain mean values specified, we develop simple sufficient conditions and methods for identifying the desired solutions.},

abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Building an accurate protein classification system depends critically upon choosing a good representation of the input sequences of amino acids. Recent work using string kernels for protein data has achieved state-of-the-art classification performance. However, such representations are based only on labeled data--examples with known 3D structures, organized into structural classes--whereas in practice, unlabeled data are far more plentiful. RESULTS: In this work, we develop simple and scalable cluster kernel techniques for incorporating unlabeled data into the representation of protein sequences. We show that our methods greatly improve the classification performance of string kernels and outperform standard approaches for using unlabeled data, such as adding close homologs of the positive examples to the training data. We achieve equal or superior performance to previously presented cluster kernel methods and at the same time achieving far greater computational efficiency.

abstract = {Reconstructing a gene network from high-throughput molecular data is often a challenging task, as the number of parameters to estimate easily is much larger than the sample size. A conventional remedy is to regularize or penalize the model likelihood. In network models, this is often done locally in the neighbourhood of each node or gene. However, estimation of the many regularization parameters is often difficult and can result in large statistical uncertainties. In this paper we propose to combine local regularization with global shrinkage of the regularization parameters to borrow strength between genes and improve inference. We employ a simple Bayesian model with non-sparse, conjugate priors to facilitate the use of fast variational approximations to posteriors. We discuss empirical Bayes estimation of hyper-parameters of the priors, and propose a novel approach to rank-based posterior thresholding. Using extensive model- and data-based simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed inference strategy outperforms popular (sparse) methods, yields more stable edges, and is more reproducible.},

abstract = {Gold-standard approaches to missing data imputation are complicated and computationally expensive. We present a principled solution to this situation, using copula distributions from which missing data may be quickly drawn. We compare this approach to other imputation techniques and show that it performs at least as well as less computationally efficient approaches. Our results demonstrate that most applied researchers can achieve great speed improvements implementing a copula-based imputation approach, while still maintaining the performance of other approaches to multiple imputation. Moreover, this approach can be easily implemented at the point of need in Bayesian analyses.},

@article{Gelman2014a,
abstract = {We revisit expectation propagation (EP) as a prototype for scalable algorithms that partition big datasets into many parts and analyze each part in parallel to perform inference of shared parameters. The algorithm should be particularly efficient for hierarchical models, for which the EP algorithm works on the shared parameters (hyperparameters) of the model.   The central idea of EP is to work at each step with a "tilted distribution" that combines the likelihood for a part of the data with the "cavity distribution," which is the approximate model for the prior and all other parts of the data. EP iteratively approximates the moments of the tilted distributions and incorporates those approximations into a global posterior approximation. As such, EP can be used to divide the computation for large models into manageable sizes. The computation for each partition can be made parallel with occasional exchanging of information between processes through the global posterior approximation. Moments of multivariate tilted distributions can be approximated in various ways, including, MCMC, Laplace approximations, and importance sampling.},

abstract = {Mass Spectrometric Imaging (MSI) is a molecular imaging technique that allows the generation of 2D ion density maps for a large complement of the active molecules present in cells and sectioned tissues. Automatic segmentation of such maps according to patterns of co-expression of individual molecules can be used for discovery of novel molecular signatures (molecules that are specifically expressed in particular spatial regions). However, current segmentation techniques are biased toward the discovery of higher abundance molecules and large segments; they allow limited opportunity for user interaction, and validation is usually performed by similarity to known anatomical features. We describe here a novel method, AMASS (Algorithm for MSI Analysis by Semi-supervised Segmentation). AMASS relies on the discriminating power of a molecular signal instead of its intensity as a key feature, uses an internal consistency measure for validation, and allows significant user interaction and supervision as options. An automated segmentation of entire leech embryo data images resulted in segmentation domains congruent with many known organs, including heart, CNS ganglia, nephridia, nephridiopores, and lateral and ventral regions, each with a distinct molecular signature. Likewise, segmentation of a rat brain MSI slice data set yielded known brain features and provided interesting examples of co-expression between distinct brain regions. AMASS represents a new approach for the discovery of peptide masses with distinct spatial features of expression. Software source code and installation and usage guide are available at http://bix.ucsd.edu/AMASS/ .},

In particular, enforcing a smooth output change while presenting temporally-closed frames from video sequences, proved to be an effective strategy. In this paper we prove the efficacy of temporal coherence for semi-supervised incremental tuning. We show that a deep architecture, just mildly trained in a supervised manner, can progressively improve its classification accuracy, if exposed to video sequences of unlabeled data. The extent to which, in some cases, a semi-supervised tuning allows to improve classification accuracy (approaching the supervised one) is somewhat surprising. A number of control experiments pointed out the fundamental role of temporal coherence.},

@article{Li2013a,
abstract = {In this paper, we study the heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) problem, in which the data from the source domain and the target domain are represented by heterogeneous features with different dimensions. By introducing two different projection matrices, we first transform the data from two domains into a common subspace such that the similarity between samples across different domains can be measured. We then develop two new feature mapping functions for two domains, which respectively augments the transformed source and target samples with their original features and padding zeros. Existing supervised learning methods (e.g., SVM and SVR) can be readily employed by incorporating our newly proposed augmented feature representations for supervised HDA. As a showcase, we propose a novel method called Heterogeneous Feature Augmentation (HFA) based on SVM. We show that the proposed formulation can be equivalently derived as a standard Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem, which is convex and thus the global solution can be guaranteed. To additionally utilize the unlabeled data in the target domain, we further propose the semi-supervised HFA (SHFA) which can simultaneously learn the target classifier as well as infer the labels of unlabeled target samples. Comprehensive experiments on three different applications clearly demonstrate that our SHFA and HFA outperform the existing HDA methods.},

@article{Patel2015,
abstract = {A grand challenge in machine learning is the development of computational al-gorithms that match or outperform humans in perceptual inference tasks such as visual object and speech recognition. The key factor complicating such tasks is the presence of numerous nuisance variables, for instance, the unknown object position, orientation, and scale in object recognition or the unknown voice pronunciation, pitch, and speed in speech recognition. Recently, a new breed of deep learning algorithms have emerged for high-nuisance inference tasks; they are constructed from many layers of alternating linear and nonlin-ear processing units and are trained using large-scale algorithms and massive amounts of training data. The recent success of deep learning systems is im-pressive — they now routinely yield pattern recognition systems with near-or super-human capabilities — but a fundamental question remains: Why do they work? Intuitions abound, but a coherent framework for understanding, analyzing, and synthesizing deep learning architectures has remained elusive. We answer this question by developing a new probabilistic framework for deep learning based on a Bayesian generative probabilistic model that explicitly cap-tures variation due to nuisance variables. The graphical structure of the model enables it to be learned from data using classical expectation-maximization techniques. Furthermore, by relaxing the generative model to a discriminative one, we can recover two of the current leading deep learning systems, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNs) and random decision forests (RDFs), providing insights into their successes and shortcomings as well as a princi-pled route to their improvement.},

abstract = {Middle-aged offspring of nonagenarians, as compared to their spouses (controls), show a favorable lipid metabolism marked by larger LDL particle size in men and lower total triglyceride levels in women. To investigate which specific lipids associate with familial longevity, we explore the plasma lipidome by measuring 128 lipid species using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in 1526 offspring of nonagenarians (59 years ± 6.6) and 675 (59 years ± 7.4) controls from the Leiden Longevity Study. In men, no significant differences were observed between offspring and controls. In women, however, 19 lipid species associated with familial longevity. Female offspring showed higher levels of ether phosphocholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species (3.5-8.7{\%}) and lower levels of phosphoethanolamine PE (38:6) and long-chain triglycerides (TG) (9.4-12.4{\%}). The association with familial longevity of two ether PC and four SM species was independent of total triglyceride levels. In addition, the longevity-associated lipid profile was characterized by a higher ratio of monounsaturated (MUFA) over polyunsaturated (PUFA) lipid species, suggesting that female offspring have a plasma lipidome less prone to oxidative stress. Ether PC and SM species were identified as novel longevity markers in females, independent of total triglycerides levels. Several longevity-associated lipids correlated with a lower risk of hypertension and diabetes in the Leiden Longevity Study cohort. This sex-specific lipid signature marks familial longevity and may suggest a plasma lipidome with a better antioxidant capacity, lower lipid peroxidation and inflammatory precursors, and an efficient beta-oxidation function.},

We argue that, contrary to folk intuition, model complexity and degrees of freedom are not synonymous and may correspond very poorly. We exhibit and theoretically explore various examples of fitting procedures for which degrees of freedom is not monotonic in the model complexity parameter, and can exceed the total dimension of the response space. Even in very simple settings, the degrees of freedom can exceed the dimension of the ambient space by an arbitrarily large amount. We show the degrees of freedom for any non-convex projection method can be unbounded.},

abstract = {Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals, blocks, and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet. This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes, matrix factorization techniques, and hierarchical regression models with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes, and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others, and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball.},

We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation in the context of very small samples. RESULTS: An extensive simulation study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules-linear discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)-using both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision), root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).},

@article{VanderKooi2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated how much the Human Development Index (HDI), a global measure of development, modifies the effect of education on self-reported health.

METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional World Health Survey data on 217,642 individuals from 49 countries, collected in 2002 to 2005, with random-intercept multilevel linear regression models.

RESULTS: We observed greater positive associations between educational levels and self-reported good health with increasing HDI. The magnitude of this effect modification of the education-health relation tended to increase with educational attainment. For example, before adjustment for effect modification, at comparable HDI, on average, finishing primary school was associated with better general health (b = 1.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.80). With adjustment for effect modification by HDI, the impact became 4.63 (95{\%} CI = 3.63, 5.62) for every 0.1 increase in HDI. Among those who completed high school, these associations were, respectively, 5.59 (95{\%} CI = 5.20, 5.98) and 9.95 (95{\%} CI = 8.89, 11.00).

CONCLUSIONS: The health benefits of educational attainment are greater in countries with greater human development. Health inequalities attributable to education are, therefore, larger in more developed countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significance analysis plays a major role in identifying and ranking genes, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation regions, and other high-throughput features associated with illness. We propose a new approach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the probability that a gene set replicates in future studies. Gene set bagging involves resampling the original high-throughput data, performing gene-set analysis on the resampled data, and confirming that biological categories replicate in the bagged samples.

RESULTS: Using both simulated and publicly-available genomics data, we demonstrate that significant categories in a gene set enrichment analysis may be unstable when subjected to resampling. We show our method estimates the replication probability (R), the probability that a gene set will replicate as a significant result in future studies, and show in simulations that this method reflects replication better than each set's p-value.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gene lists based on p-values are not necessarily stable, and therefore additional steps like gene set bagging may improve biological inference on gene sets.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a promising technology which allows for detailed analysis of spatial distributions of (bio)molecules in organic samples. In many current applications, IMS relies heavily on (semi)automated exploratory data analysis procedures to decompose the data into characteristic component spectra and corresponding abundance maps, visualizing spectral and spatial structure. The most commonly used techniques are principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Both methods operate in an unsupervised manner. However, their decomposition estimates usually feature negative counts and are not amenable to direct physical interpretation. We propose probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) for non-negative decomposition and the elucidation of interpretable component spectra and abundance maps. We compare this algorithm to PCA, ICA, and non-negative PARAFAC (parallel factors analysis) and show on simulated and real-world data that pLSA and non-negative PARAFAC are superior to PCA or ICA in terms of complementarity of the resulting components and reconstruction accuracy. We further combine pLSA decomposition with a statistical complexity estimation scheme based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to automatically estimate the number of components present in a tissue sample data set and show that this results in sensible complexity estimates.},

Classical statistical procedures, in both their frequentist and Bayesian implementations are, falsely imply they can speak about cause. No hypothesis test, or Bayes factor, should ever be used again. Even assuming we know the cause or partial cause for some set of observations, reporting via relative risk exagerates the certainty we have in the future, often by a lot. This over-certainty is made much worse when parametetric and not predictive methods are used. Unfortunately, predictive methods are rarely used; and even when they are, cause must still be an assumption, meaning (again) certainty in our scientific pronouncements is too high.},

One approach for providing theoretical understanding of this seeming discrepancy is to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically interesting input data from worst-case data sets. The hope is that there will be clustering algorithms that are provably efficient on such "clusterable" instances. This paper addresses the thesis that the computational hardness of clustering tasks goes away for inputs that one really cares about. In other words, that "Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter" (the $\backslash$emph{\{}CDNM thesis{\}} for short). I wish to present a a critical bird's eye overview of the results published on this issue so far and to call attention to the gap between available and desirable results on this issue. A longer, more detailed version of this note is available as arXiv:1507.05307. I discuss which requirements should be met in order to provide formal support to the the CDNM thesis and then examine existing results in view of these requirements and list some significant unsolved research challenges in that direction.},

abstract = {Fractional imputation (FI) is a relatively new method of imputation for handling item nonresponse in survey sampling. In FI, several imputed values with their fractional weights are created for each missing item. Each fractional weight represents the conditional probability of the imputed value given the observed data, and the parameters in the conditional probabilities are often computed by an iterative method such as EM algorithm. The underlying model for FI can be fully parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric, depending on plausibility of assumptions and the data structure. In this paper, we give an overview of FI, introduce key ideas and methods to readers who are new to the FI literature, and highlight some new development. We also provide guidance on practical implementation of FI and valid inferential tools after imputation. We demonstrate the empirical performance of FI with respect to multiple imputation using a pseudo finite population generated from a sample in Monthly Retail Trade Survey in US Census Bureau.},

abstract = {The clinical heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes. Because subtypes likely reflect distinct underlying etiologies, their identification may facilitate future genetic and pharmacotherapeutic studies. Aim of this study was to identify subtypes by a data-driven approach applied to a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor features of PD. Data of motor and nonmotor PD symptoms were collected in 802 patients in two different European prevalent cohorts. A model-based cluster analysis was conducted on baseline data of 344 patients of a Dutch cohort (PROPARK). Reproducibility of these results was tested in data of the second annual assessment of the same cohort and validated in an independent Spanish cohort (ELEP) of 357 patients. The subtypes were subsequently characterized on clinical and demographic variables. Four similar PD subtypes were identified in two different populations and are largely characterized by differences in the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications: Subtype 1 was mildly affected in all domains, Subtype 2 was predominantly characterized by severe motor complications, Subtype 3 was affected mainly on nondopaminergic domains without prominent motor complications, while Subtype 4 was severely affected on all domains. The subtypes had largely similar mean disease durations (nonsignificant differences between three clusters) but showed considerable differences with respect to their association with demographic and clinical variables. In prevalent disease, PD subtypes are largely characterized by the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications and likely reflect complex interactions between disease mechanisms, treatment, aging, and gender.},

We present this cross-validation selection strategy in the framework of meta-learning and show that conceptually, meta- learning techniques could provide better classifier selections than traditional cross-validation selection. Using various simulation studies we illustrate and discuss this possibility. Through a collection of datasets resembling real-world data, we investigate whether these improvements could possibly exist in the real-world as well. Although the approach presented here currently requires signifi- cant investment when applied to practical applications, the concept of being able to outperform cross-validation selection opens the door to new classifier selection strategies.},

While research efforts have raised hopes of early and less invasive diagnosis, they have also brought to light the many issues to be tackled before mass-spectra-based proteomic patterns become routine clinical tools. Known issues cover the entire pipeline leading from sample collection through mass spectrometry analytics to biomarker pattern extraction, validation, and interpretation. This study focuses on the data-analytical phase, which takes as input mass spectra of biological specimens and discovers patterns of peak masses and intensities that discriminate between different pathological states. We survey current work and investigate computational issues concerning the different stages of the knowledge discovery process: exploratory analysis, quality control, and diverse transforms of mass spectra, followed by further dimensionality reduction, classification, and model evaluation. We conclude after a brief discussion of the critical biomedical task of analyzing discovered discriminatory patterns to identify their component proteins as well as interpret and validate their biological implications.},

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

Unfortunately, it is well known, however, that many of the classic agglomerative clustering algorithms are not robust to noise $\backslash$cite{\{}qcluster2005{\}}. In this paper we propose and analyze a new robust algorithm for bottom-up agglomerative clustering. We show that our algorithm can be used to cluster accurately in cases where the data satisfies a number of natural properties and where the traditional agglomerative algorithms fail. We also show how to adapt our algorithm to the inductive setting where our given data is only a small random sample of the entire data set. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real world data sets show that our algorithm consistently achieves better performance than other hierarchical algorithms in the presence of noise.},

abstract = {The performance of binary classification tasks, such as action classification and object detection, is often measured in terms of the average precision (AP). Yet it is common practice in computer vision to employ the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which optimizes a surrogate 0-1 loss. The popularity of SVM can be attributed to its empirical performance. Specifically, in fully supervised settings, SVM tends to provide similar accuracy to the AP-SVM classifier, which directly optimizes an AP-based loss. However, we hypothesize that in the significantly more challenging and practically useful setting of weakly supervised learning, it becomes crucial to optimize the right accuracy measure. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose a novel latent AP-SVM that minimizes a carefully designed upper bound on the AP-based loss function over weakly supervised samples. Using publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of our approach over standard loss-based binary classifiers on two challenging problems: action classification and character recognition.},

@article{Greenland1985,
abstract = {The authors examine some recently proposed criteria for determining when to adjust for covariates related to misclassification, and show these criteria to be incorrect. In particular, they show that when misclassification is present, covariate control can sometimes increase net bias, even when the covariate would have been a confounder under perfect classification, and even if the covariate is a determinant of classification. Thus, bias due to misclassification cannot be adequately dealt with by the methods used for control of confounding. The examples presented also show that the "change-in-estimate" criterion for deciding whether to control a covariate can be systematically misleading when misclassification is present. These results demonstrate that it is necessary to consider the degree of misclassification when deciding whether to control a covariate.},

abstract = {In this letter, we investigate the impact of choosing different loss functions from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory. We introduce a convexity assumption, which is met by all loss functions commonly used in the literature, and study how the bound on the estimation error changes with the loss. We also derive a general result on the minimizer of the expected risk for a convex loss function in the case of classification. The main outcome of our analysis is that for classification, the hinge loss appears to be the loss of choice. Other things being equal, the hinge loss leads to a convergence rate practically indistinguishable from the logistic loss rate and much better than the square loss rate. Furthermore, if the hypothesis space is sufficiently rich, the bounds obtained for the hinge loss are not loosened by the thresholding stage.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop an approach to exploiting kernel methods with manifold-valued data. In many computer vision problems, the data can be naturally represented as points on a Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, usual Euclidean computer vision and machine learning algorithms yield inferior results on such data. In this paper, we define Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)-based positive definite kernels on manifolds that permit us to embed a given manifold with a corresponding metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These kernels make it possible to utilize algorithms developed for linear spaces on nonlinear manifold-valued data. Since the Gaussian RBF defined with any given metric is not always positive definite, we present a unified framework for analyzing the positive definiteness of the Gaussian RBF on a generic metric space. We then use the proposed framework to identify positive definite kernels on two specific manifolds commonly encountered in computer vision: the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and the Grassmann manifold, i.e., the Riemannian manifold of linear subspaces of a Euclidean space. We show that many popular algorithms designed for Euclidean spaces, such as support vector machines, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis can be generalized to Riemannian manifolds with the help of such positive definite Gaussian kernels.},

abstract = {<p>Semi-supervised learning has become an important and thoroughly studied subdomain of machine learning in the past few years, because gathering large unlabeled data is almost costless, and the costly human labeling process can be minimized by semi-supervision. Label propagation is a transductive semi-supervised learning method that operates on the—most of the time undirected—data graph. It was introduced in [8] and since many variants were proposed. However, the base algorithm has two variants: the first variant presented in [8] and its slightly modified version used afterwards, e.g. in [7]. This paper presents and compares the two algorithms—both theoretically and experimentally—and also tries to make a recommendation which variant to use.</p>},

abstract = {Developing theoretical foundations for learning is a key step towards understanding intelligence. 'Learning from examples' is a paradigm in which systems (natural or artificial) learn a functional relationship from a training set of examples. Within this paradigm, a learning algorithm is a map from the space of training sets to the hypothesis space of possible functional solutions. A central question for the theory is to determine conditions under which a learning algorithm will generalize from its finite training set to novel examples. A milestone in learning theory was a characterization of conditions on the hypothesis space that ensure generalization for the natural class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) learning algorithms that are based on minimizing the error on the training set. Here we provide conditions for generalization in terms of a precise stability property of the learning process: when the training set is perturbed by deleting one example, the learned hypothesis does not change much. This stability property stipulates conditions on the learning map rather than on the hypothesis space, subsumes the classical theory for ERM algorithms, and is applicable to more general algorithms. The surprising connection between stability and predictivity has implications for the foundations of learning theory and for the design of novel algorithms, and provides insights into problems as diverse as language learning and inverse problems in physics and engineering.},

The result is a family of parameter-free ensemble aggregation algorithms, which are as efficient as linear learning and prediction for convex risk minimization but work without any relaxations whatsoever on many nonconvex losses like the 0-1 loss. The prediction algorithms take a familiar form, applying "link functions" to a generalized notion of ensemble margin, but without the assumptions typically made in margin-based learning - all this structure follows from a minimax interpretation of loss minimization.},

abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models have increasingly replaced mixed-model analyses of variance for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. The advantages of LMMs over ANOVAs, however, come at a cost: Setting up an LMM is not as straightforward as running an ANOVA. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr et al., 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, models with a random effect structure that is supported by the data have optimal Type I error and power properties.},

@article{Gardner2015,
abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly used in high impact applications such as prediction of hospital re-admission, cancer screening or bio-medical research applications. As predictions become increasingly accurate, practitioners may be interested in identifying actionable changes to inputs in order to alter their class membership. For example, a doctor might want to know what changes to a patient's status would predict him/her to not be re-admitted to the hospital soon. Szegedy et al. (2013b) demonstrated that identifying such changes can be very hard in image classification tasks. In fact, tiny, imperceptible changes can result in completely different predictions without any change to the true class label of the input. In this paper we ask the question if we can make small but meaningful changes in order to truly alter the class membership of images from a source class to a target class. To this end we propose deep manifold traversal, a method that learns the manifold of natural images and provides an effective mechanism to move images from one area (dominated by the source class) to another (dominated by the target class).The resulting algorithm is surprisingly effective and versatile. It allows unrestricted movements along the image manifold and only requires few images from source and target to identify meaningful changes. We demonstrate that the exact same procedure can be used to change an individual's appearance of age, facial expressions or even recolor black and white images.},

abstract = {As increasingly complex hypothesis-testing scenarios are considered in many scientific fields, analytic derivation of null distributions is often out of reach. To the rescue comes Monte Carlo testing, which may appear deceptively simple: as long as you can sample test statistics under the null hypothesis, the p-value is just the proportion of sampled test statistics that exceed the observed test statistic. Sampling test statistics is often simple once you have a Monte Carlo null model for your data, and defining some form of randomization procedure is also, in many cases, relatively straightforward. However, there may be several possible choices of randomization null model for the data, and no clear-cut criteria for choosing among them. Obviously, different null models may lead to very different p-values, and a very low p-value may thus occur due to the inadequacy of the chosen null model. It is preferable to use assumptions about the underlying random data generation process to guide selection of a null model. In many cases, we may order the null models by increasing preservation of the data characteristics, and we argue in this paper that this ordering in most cases gives increasing p-values, i.e. lower significance. We denote this as the null complexity principle. The principle gives a better understanding of the different null models and may guide in the choice between the different models.},

As such, they have been successfully used to scale up clustering models such as K-Means and Gaussian mixture models to massive datasets. However, until now, the algorithms and corresponding theory were usually specific to each clustering problem. We propose a single, practical algorithm to construct strong coresets for a large class of hard and soft clustering problems based on Bregman divergences. This class includes hard clustering with popular distortion measures such as the Squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance, KL-divergence, Itakura-Saito distance and relative entropy. The corresponding soft clustering problems are directly related to popular mixture models due to a dual relationship between Bregman divergences and Exponential family distributions. Our results recover existing coreset constructions for K-Means and Gaussian mixture models and imply polynomial time approximations schemes for various hard clustering problems.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) exploits sparsity to recover sparse or compressible signals from dimensionality reducing, non-adaptive sensing mechanisms. Sparsity is also used to enhance interpretability in machine learning and statistics applications: While the ambient dimension is vast in modern data analysis problems, the relevant information therein typically resides in a much lower dimensional space. However, many solutions proposed nowadays do not leverage the true underlying structure. Recent results in CS extend the simple sparsity idea to more sophisticated {\{}$\backslash$em structured{\}} sparsity models, which describe the interdependency between the nonzero components of a signal, allowing to increase the interpretability of the results and lead to better recovery performance. In order to better understand the impact of structured sparsity, in this chapter we analyze the connections between the discrete models and their convex relaxations, highlighting their relative advantages. We start with the general group sparse model and then elaborate on two important special cases: the dispersive and the hierarchical models. For each, we present the models in their discrete nature, discuss how to solve the ensuing discrete problems and then describe convex relaxations. We also consider more general structures as defined by set functions and present their convex proxies. Further, we discuss efficient optimization solutions for structured sparsity problems and illustrate structured sparsity in action via three applications.},

abstract = {The pursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the conception of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is possible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single, unifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper' learning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and stochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside of the model. We show that, under surprisingly weak conditions, both conditions are, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a re-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities, linking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we show how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we prove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of the Tsybakov-Mammen margin condition, which has played a central role in obtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein condition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more suitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our condition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by Juditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov, and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying conditions thus provide a significant step towards a characterization of fast rates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability characterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice setting.},

abstract = {A low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace clustering and classification is here proposed. Many high-dimensional data, such as face images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However, low-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a high-rank structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce variations within the subspaces, and increase separation between the subspaces for a more robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing subspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to further support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of the transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering technique, called Robust Sparse Subspace Clustering, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling. When class labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank transformation framework also significantly enhances classification performance. Extensive experiments using public datasets are presented, showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering and classification.},

Specifically, we transform the inputs of a spectral mixture base kernel with a deep architecture, using local kernel interpolation, inducing points, and structure exploiting (Kronecker and Toeplitz) algebra for a scalable kernel representation. These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. Inference and learning cost {\$}O(n){\$} for {\$}n{\$} training points, and predictions cost {\$}O(1){\$} per test point. On a large and diverse collection of applications, including a dataset with 2 million examples, we show improved performance over scalable Gaussian processes with flexible kernel learning models, and stand-alone deep architectures.},

abstract = {In order to study the molecular biological differences between normal and diseased tissues, it is desirable to perform classification among diseases and stages of disease using microarray-based gene-expression values. Owing to the limited number of microarrays typically used in these studies, serious issues arise with respect to the design, performance and analysis of classifiers based on microarray data. This paper reviews some fundamental issues facing small-sample classification: classification rules, constrained classifiers, error estimation and feature selection. It discusses both unconstrained and constrained classifier design from sample data, and the contributions to classifier error from constrained optimization and lack of optimality owing to design from sample data. The difficulty with estimating classifier error when confined to small samples is addressed, particularly estimating the error from training data. The impact of small samples on the ability to include more than a few variables as classifier features is explained.},

abstract = {In a longitudinal metabolomics study, multiple metabolites are measured from several observations at many time points. Interest lies in reducing the dimensionality of such data and in highlighting influential metabolites which change over time. A dynamic probabilistic principal components analysis (DPPCA) model is proposed to achieve dimension reduction while appropriately modelling the correlation due to repeated measurements. This is achieved by assuming an autoregressive model for some of the model parameters. Linear mixed models are subsequently used to identify influential metabolites which change over time. The proposed model is used to analyse data from a longitudinal metabolomics animal study.},

@article{Zafar2015,
abstract = {Automated data-driven decision systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety of online services, from online social networking and e-commerce to e-government. These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead to user discrimination, even in the absence of intent. In this paper, we introduce fairness constraints, a mechanism to ensure fairness in a wide variety of classifiers in a principled manner. Fairness prevents a classifier from outputting predictions correlated with certain sensitive attributes in the data. We then instantiate fairness constraints on three well-known classifiers -- logistic regression, hinge loss and support vector machines (SVM) -- and evaluate their performance in a real-world dataset with meaningful sensitive human attributes. Experiments show that fairness constraints allow for an optimal trade-off between accuracy and fairness.},

abstract = {We study randomized sketching methods for approximately solving least-squares problem with a general convex constraint. The quality of a least-squares approximation can be assessed in different ways: either in terms of the value of the quadratic objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some distance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true minimizer (solution approximation). Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for solution approximation. We then present a new method known as the iterative Hessian sketch, and show that it can be used to obtain approximations to the original least-squares problem using a projection dimension proportional to the statistical complexity of the least-squares minimizer, and a logarithmic number of iterations. We illustrate our general theory with simulations for both unconstrained and constrained versions of least-squares, including {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$}-regularization and nuclear norm constraints. We also numerically demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a real face expression classification experiment.},

@article{Zach2014,
abstract = {In this work, we present a unified view on Markov random fields (MRFs) and recently proposed continuous tight convex relaxations for multilabel assignment in the image plane. These relaxations are far less biased toward the grid geometry than Markov random fields on grids. It turns out that the continuous methods are nonlinear extensions of the well-established local polytope MRF relaxation. In view of this result, a better understanding of these tight convex relaxations in the discrete setting is obtained. Further, a wider range of optimization methods is now applicable to find a minimizer of the tight formulation. We propose two methods to improve the efficiency of minimization. One uses a weaker, but more efficient continuously inspired approach as initialization and gradually refines the energy where it is necessary. The other one reformulates the dual energy enabling smooth approximations to be used for efficient optimization. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed minimization schemes in numerical experiments. Finally, we generalize the underlying energy formulation from isotropic metric smoothness costs to arbitrary nonmetric and orientation dependent smoothness terms.},

@article{Wickenberg-Bolin2006,
abstract = {Supervised learning for classification of cancer employs a set of design examples to learn how to discriminate between tumors. In practice it is crucial to confirm that the classifier is robust with good generalization performance to new examples, or at least that it performs better than random guessing. A suggested alternative is to obtain a confidence interval of the error rate using repeated design and test sets selected from available examples. However, it is known that even in the ideal situation of repeated designs and tests with completely novel samples in each cycle, a small test set size leads to a large bias in the estimate of the true variance between design sets. Therefore different methods for small sample performance estimation such as a recently proposed procedure called Repeated Random Sampling (RSS) is also expected to result in heavily biased estimates, which in turn translates into biased confidence intervals. Here we explore such biases and develop a refined algorithm called Repeated Independent Design and Test (RIDT).},

abstract = {We demonstrate the usefulness of submodularity in statistics. Greedy algorithms such as forward stepwise regression and the lasso perform well in situations that can be characterized by submodularity. In particular, submodularity of the coefficient of determination, R{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}, provides a natural way to analyze the effects of collinearity on model selection. In model selection, we encounter the search problem of identifying a subset of k covariates with predictive loss close to that of the best model of k covariates. Submodularity arises naturally in this setting due to its deep roots within combinatorial optimization. It provides structural results for discrete convexity as well as guarantees for the success of greedy algorithms. In statistics, submodularity isolates cases in which collinearity makes the choice of model features difficult from those in which this task is routine. Submodularity of R{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} is closely related to other statistical assumptions used in variable screening and proving the performance of the Lasso. This has important implications for the use of model selection procedures: the situations in which forward stepwise and Lasso are successful are closely related.},

The aim of this paper was to develop a model-based clustering approach to identify homogeneous sibling pairs according to their health status. Model-based clustering approaches will be considered on the basis of linear mixed effect model for the mixture components. Class memberships of siblings within pairs are allowed to be correlated, and within a class the correlation between siblings is modeled using random sibling pair effects. We propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. Model performance is evaluated via simulations in terms of estimating the correct parameters, degree of agreement, and the ability to detect the correct number of clusters. The performance of our model is compared with the performance of standard model-based clustering approaches. The methods are used to classify sibling pairs from the Leiden Longevity Study according to their health status. Our results suggest that homogeneous healthy sibling pairs are associated with a longer life span. Software is available for fitting the new models.},

It is based on the idea that a stochastic model is adequate if samples generated under the model are very much like the sample actually obtained. The formalization is based on the concept of data feature. Examples are given of applying the ideas to different areas of statistics including location-scale models, densities, non-parametric regression, interlaboratory test, auto-regressive processes and the analysis of variance. The four cornerstones of the approach are direct comparison, approximation, weak topologies and parsimony. The approach is contrasted to that of much of conventional statistics many of whose concepts are pathologically discontinuous with respect to the topology of data analysis and common sense.},

abstract = {In epigenome-wide association studies, cell-type composition often differs between cases and controls, yielding associations that simply tag cell type rather than reveal fundamental biology. Current solutions require actual or estimated cell-type composition--information not easily obtainable for many samples of interest. We propose a method, FaST-LMM-EWASher, that automatically corrects for cell-type composition without the need for explicit knowledge of it, and then validate our method by comparison with the state-of-the-art approach. Corresponding software is available from http://www.microsoft.com/science/.},

abstract = {Measurements from microarrays and other high-throughput technologies are susceptible to non-biological artifacts like batch effects. It is known that batch effects can alter or obscure the set of significant results and biological conclusions in high-throughput studies. Here we examine the impact of batch effects on predictors built from genomic technologies. To investigate batch effects, we collected publicly available gene expression measurements with known outcomes, and estimated batches using date. Using these data we show (1) the impact of batch effects on prediction depends on the correlation between outcome and batch in the training data, and (2) removing expression measurements most affected by batch before building predictors may improve the accuracy of those predictors. These results suggest that (1) training sets should be designed to minimize correlation between batches and outcome, and (2) methods for identifying batch-affected probes should be developed to improve prediction results for studies with high correlation between batches and outcome.},

abstract = {Convex optimization is an essential tool for modern data analysis, as it provides a framework to formulate and solve many problems in machine learning and data mining. However, general convex optimization solvers do not scale well, and scalable solvers are often specialized to only work on a narrow class of problems. Therefore, there is a need for simple, scalable algorithms that can solve many common optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the $\backslash$emph{\{}network lasso{\}}, a generalization of the group lasso to a network setting that allows for simultaneous clustering and optimization on graphs. We develop an algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in a distributed and scalable manner, which allows for guaranteed global convergence even on large graphs. We also examine a non-convex extension of this approach. We then demonstrate that many types of problems can be expressed in our framework. We focus on three in particular - binary classification, predicting housing prices, and event detection in time series data - comparing the network lasso to baseline approaches and showing that it is both a fast and accurate method of solving large optimization problems.},

@article{Shimodaira2015,
abstract = {We derive an information criterion for selecting a parametric model of complete-data distribution when only incomplete or partially observed data is available. Compared with AIC, the new criterion has an additional penalty term for missing data expressed by the Fisher information matrices of complete data and incomplete data. We prove that the new criterion is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the estimated distribution for complete data, whereas AIC is that for the incomplete data. Information criteria PDIO (Shimodaira 1994) and AICcd (Cavanaugh and Shumway 1998) have been previously proposed for the same purpose. Recently, an error is found in the derivation of PDIO, and the new information criterion is obtained by correcting the error. The additional penalty for missing data turns out to be only the half of what is claimed in PDIO. Geometrical view of alternating minimizations of the EM algorithm plays an important role for the derivation.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. The results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We compute LOO using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

@article{Madeira2004a,
abstract = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

This generalizes in a natural way the notion of regularization and Greens functions, as commonly used for real valued functions, to graphs. It turns out that diffusion kernels can be found as a special case of our reasoning. We show that the class of positive, monotonically decreasing functions on the unit interval leads to kernels and corresponding regularization operators.},

abstract = {Representations offered by deep generative models are fundamentally tied to their inference method from data. Variational inference methods require a rich family of approximating distributions. We construct the variational Gaussian process (VGP), a Bayesian nonparametric model which adapts its shape to match complex posterior distributions. The VGP generates approximate posterior samples by generating latent inputs and warping them through random non-linear mappings; the distribution over random mappings is learned during inference, enabling the transformed outputs to adapt to varying complexity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for the VGP, demonstrating its representative power for learning any model. For inference we present a variational objective inspired by autoencoders and perform black box inference over a wide class of models. The VGP achieves new state-of-the-art results for unsupervised learning, inferring models such as the deep latent Gaussian model and the recently proposed DRAW.},

As special cases of our results, we derive explicit expressions for the degrees of freedom in many shape restricted regression problems, e.g., bounded isotonic regression, multivariate convex regression and penalized convex regression. Our general theory also yields, as special cases, known results on the degrees of freedom of many well-studied estimators in the statistics literature, such as ridge regression, Lasso and generalized Lasso. Our results can be readily used to choose the tuning parameter(s) involved in the estimation procedure by minimizing the Stein's unbiased risk estimate. We illustrate this through simulation studies for bounded isotonic regression and penalized convex regression.},

abstract = {In many situations we have some measurement of confidence on " positiveness " for a binary label. The " positiveness " is a continuous value whose range is a bounded interval. It quantifies the affiliation of each training data to the positive class. We propose a novel learning algorithm called expectation loss SVM (e-SVM) that is devoted to the problems where only the " positiveness " instead of a binary label of each training sample is available. Our e-SVM algorithm can also be readily extended to learn segment classifiers under weak supervision where the exact positiveness value of each training example is unobserved. In experiments, we show that the e-SVM algorithm can effectively address the segment proposal classification task under both strong supervision (e.g. the pixel-level annotations are available) and the weak supervision (e.g. only bounding-box annotations are available), and outperforms the alternative approaches. Besides, we further vali-date this method on two major tasks of computer vision: semantic segmentation and object detection. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art object detection performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.},

abstract = {Mean shift clustering is a powerful nonparametric technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters and does not constrain the shape of the clusters. However, being completely unsupervised, its performance suffers when the original distance metric fails to capture the underlying cluster structure. Despite recent advances in semi-supervised clustering methods, there has been little effort towards incorporating supervision into mean shift. We propose a semi-supervised framework for kernel mean shift clustering (SKMS) that uses only pairwise constraints to guide the clustering procedure. The points are first mapped to a high-dimensional kernel space where the constraints are imposed by a linear transformation of the mapped points. This is achieved by modifying the initial kernel matrix by minimizing a log det divergence-based objective function.We show the advantages of SKMS by evaluating its performance on various synthetic and real datasets while comparing with state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {Just as diagnostic tests are most helpful in light of the clinical presentation, statistical tests are most useful in the context of scientific knowledge. Knowing the specificity and sensitivity of a diagnostic test is necessary, but insufficient: the clinician must also estimate the prior probability of the disease. In the same way, knowing the P value and power, or the confidence interval, for the results of a research study is necessary but insufficient: the reader must estimate the prior probability that the research hypothesis is true. Just as a positive diagnostic test does not mean that a patient has the disease, especially if the clinical picture suggests otherwise, a significant P value does not mean that a research hypothesis is correct, especially if it is inconsistent with current knowledge. Powerful studies are like sensitive tests in that they can be especially useful when the results are negative. Very low P values are like very specific tests; both result in few false-positive results due to chance. This Bayesian approach can clarify much of the confusion surrounding the use and interpretation of statistical tests.},

abstract = {Empirical research in learning algorithms for classification tasks gen- erally requires the use of significance tests.The quality of a test is typically judged on Type I error (how often the test indicates a difference when it should not) and Type II error (how often it indicates no difference when it should). In this paper we argue that the replicability of a test is also of importance.We say that a test has low replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particular random parti- tioning of the data that is used to perform it. We present empirical measures of replicability and use them to compare the performance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involving standard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets. Based on our results we give recommendations on which test to use.},

One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

abstract = {How should one statistically analyze privacy-enhanced data? In theory, one could process it exactly as if it were normal data since many differentially private algorithms asymptotically converge exponentially fast to their non-private counterparts and/or have error that asymptotically decreases as fast as sampling error. In practice, convergence often requires enormous amounts of data. Thus making differential privacy practical requires the development of techniques that specifically account for the noise that is added for the sake of providing privacy guarantees. Such techniques are especially needed for statistical hypothesis testing. Previous approaches either ignored the added noise (resulting in highly biased {\$}p{\$}-values), accounted for the noise but had high variance, or accounted for the noise while having small variance but were restricted to very specific types of data sets. In this paper, we propose statistical tests of independence that address all three problems simultaneously -- they add small amounts of noise, account for this noise to produce accurate {\$}p{\$}-values, and have no restrictions on the types of tables to which they are applicable. Along with these tests, we propose an alternative methodology for computing the asymptotic distributions of test statistics that results in better finite-sample approximations when using differential privacy to protect data.},

To mitigate this effect, we develop the profile predictive, a predictive density that incorporates the population distribution of data into Bayesian inference. This leads to a practical method for reducing the effect of model mismatch. We extend this method into variational inference and propose a stochastic optimization algorithm, called bumping variational inference. We demonstrate improved predictive accuracy over classical variational inference in two models: a Bayesian mixture model of image histograms and a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model of a text corpus.},

abstract = {Improvement guarantees for semi-supervised classifiers can currently only be given under restrictive conditions on the data. We propose a general way to perform semi-supervised parameter estimation for likelihood-based classifiers for which, on the full training set, the estimates are never worse than the supervised solution in terms of the log-likelihood. We argue, moreover, that we may expect these solutions to really improve upon the supervised classifier in particular cases. In a worked-out example for LDA, we take it one step further and essentially prove that its semi-supervised version is strictly better than its supervised counterpart. The two new concepts that form the core of our estimation principle are contrast and pessimism. The former refers to the fact that our objective function takes the supervised estimates into account, enabling the semi-supervised solution to explicitly control the potential improvements over this estimate. The latter refers to the fact that our estimates are conservative and therefore resilient to whatever form the true labeling of the unlabeled data takes on. Experiments demonstrate the improvements in terms of both the log-likelihood and the classification error rate on independent test sets.},

Among solutions to this problem, digital libraries are increasingly offering tools for authors to manually curate their publications and claim those that are theirs. Indirectly, these tools allow for the inexpensive collection of large annotated training data, which can be further leveraged to build a complementary automated disambiguation system capable of inferring patterns for identifying publications written by the same person. Building on more than 1 million publicly released crowdsourced annotations, we propose an automated author disambiguation solution exploiting this data (i) to learn an accurate classifier for identifying coreferring authors and (ii) to guide the clustering of scientific publications by distinct authors in a semi-supervised way. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to be carried out on data of this size and coverage. With respect to the state of the art, we validate the general pipeline used in most existing solutions, and improve by: (i) proposing phonetic-based blocking strategies, thereby increasing recall; and (ii) adding strong ethnicity-sensitive features for learning a linkage function, thereby tailoring disambiguation to non-Western author names whenever necessary.},

abstract = {Bayesian nonparametric models, such as Gaussian processes, provide a compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling: these models have a high degree of flexibility, and automatically calibrated complexity. However, automating human expertise remains elusive, for example, Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in human-like ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels. Finally, we investigate Occam's razor in human and Gaussian process based function learning.},

In this modeling scenario, the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data impacts the construction and performance of classifiers, and therefore a semi-supervised learning framework is adopted. We propose a graph classifier based on kernel smoothing. A regularization framework is also introduced, and it is shown that the proposed classifier optimizes certain loss functions. Its performance is assessed on several synthetic and real benchmark data sets with good results, especially in settings where only a small fraction of the data are labeled.},

@article{Reid2015,
abstract = {Applied statistical problems often come with pre-specified groupings to predictors. It is natural to test for the presence of simultaneous group-wide signal for groups in isolation, or for multiple groups together. Classical tests for the presence of such signals rely either on tests for the omission of the entire block of variables (the classical F-test) or on the creation of an unsupervised prototype for the group (either a group centroid or first principal component) and subsequent t-tests on these prototypes. In this paper, we propose test statistics that aim for power improvements over these classical approaches. In particular, we first create group prototypes, with reference to the response, hopefully improving on the unsupervised prototypes, and then testing with likelihood ratio statistics incorporating only these prototypes. We propose a (potentially) novel model, called the "prototype model", which naturally models the two-step prototype-then-test procedure. Furthermore, we introduce an inferential schema detailing the unique considerations for different combinations of prototype formation and univariate/multivariate testing models. The prototype model also suggests new applications to estimation and prediction. Prototype formation often relies on variable selection, which invalidates classical Gaussian test theory. We use recent advances in selective inference to account for selection in the prototyping step and retain test validity. Simulation experiments suggest that our testing procedure enjoys more power than do classical approaches.},

abstract = {MALDI mass spectrometry can generate profiles that contain hundreds of biomolecular ions directly from tissue. Spatially-correlated analysis, MALDI imaging MS, can simultaneously reveal how each of these biomolecular ions varies in clinical tissue samples. The use of statistical data analysis tools to identify regions containing correlated mass spectrometry profiles is referred to as imaging MS-based molecular histology because of its ability to annotate tissues solely on the basis of the imaging MS data. Several reports have indicated that imaging MS-based molecular histology may be able to complement established histological and histochemical techniques by distinguishing between pathologies with overlapping/identical morphologies and revealing biomolecular intratumor heterogeneity. A data analysis pipeline that identifies regions of imaging MS datasets with correlated mass spectrometry profiles could lead to the development of novel methods for improved diagnosis (differentiating subgroups within distinct histological groups) and annotating the spatio-chemical makeup of tumors. Here it is demonstrated that highlighting the regions within imaging MS datasets whose mass spectrometry profiles were found to be correlated by five independent multivariate methods provides a consistently accurate summary of the spatio-chemical heterogeneity. The corroboration provided by using multiple multivariate methods, efficiently applied in an automated routine, provides assurance that the identified regions are indeed characterized by distinct mass spectrometry profiles, a crucial requirement for its development as a complementary histological tool. When simultaneously applied to imaging MS datasets from multiple patient samples of intermediate-grade myxofibrosarcoma, a heterogeneous soft tissue sarcoma, nodules with mass spectrometry profiles found to be distinct by five different multivariate methods were detected within morphologically identical regions of all patient tissue samples. To aid the further development of imaging MS based molecular histology as a complementary histological tool the Matlab code of the agreement analysis, instructions and a reduced dataset are included as supporting information.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of LCGA and GMM, compare the different techniques of latent growth modeling, discuss current debates and issues, and provide readers with a practical guide for conducting LCGA and GMM using the Mplus software.},

The utility of such approaches is highlighted in the software package STAN, which provides a platform for automatic implementation of general Bayesian models. Hence, methods for improving the efficiency of general Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms can have a substantial impact on practice. We propose such a method in this article by recycling the intermediate leap-frog steps used in approximating the Hamiltonian trajectories. Current algorithms use only the final step, and wastefully discard all the intermediate steps. We propose a simple and provably accurate approach for using these intermediate samples, boosting the effective sample size with little programming effort and essentially no extra computational cost. We show that our recycled Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm can lead to substantial gains in computational efficiency in a variety of experiments.},

abstract = {Archetypal analysis represents a set of observations as convex combinations of pure patterns, or archetypes. The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real valued. This, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.},

@article{Dagenais1971,
abstract = {The purpose of this article is to suggest a method of estimating parameters of linear regressions containing two independent variables, when data is missing among these variables. The problem envisaged concerns the case where: (1) the independent variables are considered as fixed numbers; (2) each observation contains the values of the dependent variable and at least one of the independent variables; (3) some observations are complete. In contrast with other approaches dealing with similar problems, the technique developed in this article has the following advantages: (1) it is based on rather unrestrictive hypotheses; (2) the resulting estimators are consistent; (3) the asymptotic variances of these estimators are smaller than those of comparable estimators described in the literature. Although the question is not examined in the present article, it seems also that the proposed method offers good possibilities of generalization.},

@article{Hanselmann2013,
abstract = {Digital staining for the automated annotation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data has previously been achieved using state-of-the-art classifiers such as random forests or support vector machines (SVMs). However, the training of such classifiers requires an expert to label exemplary data in advance. This process is time-consuming and hence costly, especially if the tissue is heterogeneous. In theory, it may be sufficient to only label a few highly representative pixels of an MS image, but it is not known a priori which pixels to select. This motivates active learning strategies in which the algorithm itself queries the expert by automatically suggesting promising candidate pixels of an MS image for labeling. Given a suitable querying strategy, the number of required training labels can be significantly reduced while maintaining classification accuracy. In this work, we propose active learning for convenient annotation of MSI data. We generalize a recently proposed active learning method to the multiclass case and combine it with the random forest classifier. Its superior performance over random sampling is demonstrated on secondary ion mass spectrometry data, making it an interesting approach for the classification of MS images.},

We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones. Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable. We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning.},

abstract = {Bartlett et al. (2006) recently proved that a ground condition for surrogates, classification calibration, ties up their consistent minimization to that of the classification risk, and left as an important problem the algorithmic questions about their minimization. In this paper, we address this problem for a wide set which lies at the intersection of classification calibrated surrogates and those of Murata et al. (2004). This set coincides with those satisfying three common assumptions about surrogates. Equivalent expressions for the members-sometimes well known-follow for convex and concave surrogates, frequently used in the induction of linear separators and decision trees. Most notably, they share remarkable algorithmic features: for each of these two types of classifiers, we give a minimization algorithm provably converging to the minimum of any such surrogate. While seemingly different, we show that these algorithms are offshoots of the same "master" algorithm. This provides a new and broad unified account of different popular algorithms, including additive regression with the squared loss, the logistic loss, and the top-down induction performed in CART, C4.5. Moreover, we show that the induction enjoys the most popular boosting features, regardless of the surrogate. Experiments are provided on 40 readily available domains.},

abstract = {Feature selection techniques have been used as the workhorse in biomarker discovery applications for a long time. Surprisingly, the stability of feature selection with respect to sampling variations has long been under-considered. It is only until recently that this issue has received more and more attention. In this article, we review existing stable feature selection methods for biomarker discovery using a generic hierarchical framework. We have two objectives: (1) providing an overview on this new yet fast growing topic for a convenient reference; (2) categorizing existing methods under an expandable framework for future research and development.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion that arise in quantum physics and random matrix theory. In contrast to traditional structured models like Markov random fields, which become intractable and hard to approximate in the presence of negative correlations, DPPs offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. We provide a gentle introduction to DPPs, focusing on the intuitions, algorithms, and extensions that are most relevant to the machine learning community, and show how DPPs can be applied to real-world applications like finding diverse sets of high-quality search results, building informative summaries by selecting diverse sentences from documents, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images or video, and automatically building timelines of important news stories.},

abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.},

These tools have been generalized to the multivariate analysis of high-throughput biological datasets, where the main challenge is the problem of small sample size and high dimensionality. However, the existing multi-way analysis methods are not designed for the currently increasingly important experiments where data is obtained from multiple sources. Common examples of such settings include integrated analysis of metabolic and gene expression profiles, or metabolic profiles from several tissues in our case, in a controlled multi-way experimental setup where disease status, medical treatment, gender and time-series are usual covariates.},

abstract = {An important question in constructing Cross Validation (CV) estimators of the generalization error is whether rules can be established that allow "optimal" selection of the size of the training set, for fixed sample size {\$}n{\$}. We define the {\{}$\backslash$it resampling effectiveness{\}} of random CV estimators of the generalization error as the ratio of the limiting value of the variance of the CV estimator over the estimated from the data variance. The variance and the covariance of different average test set errors are independent of their indices, thus, the resampling effectiveness depends on the correlation and the number of repetitions used in the random CV estimator. We discuss statistical rules to define optimality and obtain the "optimal" training sample size as the solution of an appropriately formulated optimization problem. We show that in a broad class of loss functions the optimal training size equals half of the total sample size, independently of the data distribution. We optimally select the number of folds in {\$}k{\$}-fold cross validation and offer a computational procedure for obtaining the optimal splitting in the case of classification (via logistic regression). We substantiate our claims both, theoretically and empirically.},

abstract = {Maps are frequently used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or average pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the effects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite effect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be difficult to interpret because the display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models and the extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of selecting the most informative experiments x to get measurements y for learning a regression model y = f(x). We propose a novel and simple concept for active learning, transductive experimental design, that explores available unmeasured experiments (i.e., unlabeled data) and has a better scalability in comparison with classic experimental design methods. Our in-depth analysis shows that the new method tends to favor experiments that are on the one side hard-to-predict and on the other side representative for the rest of the experiments. Efficient optimization of the new design problem is achieved through alternating optimization and sequential greedy search. Extensive experimental results on synthetic problems and three real-world tasks, including questionnaire design for preference learning, active learning for text categorization, and spatial sensor placement, highlight the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {The goal of importance sampling is to estimate the expected value of a given function with respect to a probability measure {\$}\backslashnu{\$} using a random sample of size {\$}n{\$} drawn from a different probability measure {\$}\backslashmu{\$}. If the two measures {\$}\backslashmu{\$} and {\$}\backslashnu{\$} are nearly singular with respect to each other, which is often the case in practice, the sample size required for accurate estimation is large. In this article it is shown that in a fairly general setting, a sample of size approximately {\$}\backslashexp(D(\backslashnu||\backslashmu)){\$} is necessary and sufficient for accurate estimation by importance sampling, where {\$}D(\backslashnu||\backslashmu){\$} is the Kullback--Leibler divergence of {\$}\backslashmu{\$} from {\$}\backslashnu{\$}. In particular, the required sample size exhibits a kind of cut-off in the logarithmic scale. The theory is applied to obtain a fairly general formula for the sample size required in importance sampling for exponential families (Gibbs measures). We also show that the standard variance-based diagnostic for convergence of importance sampling is fundamentally problematic. An alternative diagnostic that provably works in certain situations is suggested.},

The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjec-tive or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledg-ment of multiple perspectives as complementary goals.

Development of statistical methods to address missingness have been actively pursued in recent years, including imputation, likelihood and weighting approaches. Each approach is more complicated when there are many patterns of missing values, or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard to compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories form taking much computation time.},

The method uses the connected-components structure of the sample covariance matrix to split the problem into smaller ones.

Then, it uses non-negative least squares to recombine the different vectors into a single so- lution. This step is useful in selecting and reweighting components that are correlated with the response. Simulated and real data examples show that the component lasso can outperform standard regression methods such as the lasso and elastic net, achieving a lower mean squared error as well as better support recovery.

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for learning a discriminative classifier from unlabeled or partially labeled data. Our approach is based on an objective function that trades-off mutual information between observed examples and their predicted categorical class distribution, against robustness of the classifier to an adversarial generative model. The resulting algorithm can either be interpreted as a natural generalization of the generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework or as an extension of the regularized information maximization (RIM) framework to robust classification against an optimal adversary. We empirically evaluate our method - which we dub categorical generative adversarial networks (or CatGAN) - on synthetic data as well as on challenging image classification tasks, demonstrating the robustness of the learned classifiers. We further qualitatively assess the fidelity of samples generated by the adversarial generator that is learned alongside the discriminative classifier, and identify links between the CatGAN objective and discriminative clustering algorithms (such as RIM).},

abstract = {The clinical variability between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes of the disease. Identification of subtypes is important, since a focus on homogeneous groups may enhance the chance of success of research on mechanisms of disease and may also lead to tailored treatment strategies. Cluster analysis (CA) is an objective method to classify patients into subtypes. We systematically reviewed the methodology and results of CA studies in PD to gain a better understanding of the robustness of identified subtypes. We found seven studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies were limited by incomplete reporting and methodological limitations. Differences between studies rendered comparisons of the results difficult. However, it appeared that studies which applied a comparable design identified similar subtypes. The cluster profiles "old age-at-onset and rapid disease progression" and "young age-at-onset and slow disease progression" emerged from the majority of studies.

abstract = {Variational inference has become a widely used method to approximate posteriors in complex latent variables models. However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis, and these efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a "black box" variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

abstract = {The accuracy of published medical research is critical for scientists, physicians and patients who rely on these results. However, the fundamental belief in the medical literature was called into serious question by a paper suggesting that most published medical research is false. Here we adapt estimation methods from the genomics community to the problem of estimating the rate of false discoveries in the medical literature using reported {\$}P{\$}-values as the data. We then collect {\$}P{\$}-values from the abstracts of all 77 430 papers published in The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and The American Journal of Epidemiology between 2000 and 2010. Among these papers, we found 5322 reported {\$}P{\$}-values. We estimate that the overall rate of false discoveries among reported results is 14{\%} (s.d. 1{\%}), contrary to previous claims. We also found that there is no a significant increase in the estimated rate of reported false discovery results over time (0.5{\%} more false positives (FP) per year, {\$}P = 0.18{\$}) or with respect to journal submissions (0.5{\%} more FP per 100 submissions, {\$}P = 0.12{\$}). Statistical analysis must allow for false discoveries in order to make claims on the basis of noisy data. But our analysis suggests that the medical literature remains a reliable record of scientific progress.},

@article{Kawakita2014a,
abstract = {We are interested in developing a safe semi-supervised learning that works in any situation. Semi-supervised learning postulates that n(') unlabeled data are available in addition to n labeled data. However, almost all of the previous semi-supervised methods require additional assumptions (not only unlabeled data) to make improvements on supervised learning. If such assumptions are not met, then the methods possibly perform worse than supervised learning. Sokolovska, Capp{\'{e}}, and Yvon (2008) proposed a semi-supervised method based on a weighted likelihood approach. They proved that this method asymptotically never performs worse than supervised learning (i.e., it is safe) without any assumption. Their method is attractive because it is easy to implement and is potentially general. Moreover, it is deeply related to a certain statistical paradox. However, the method of Sokolovska et al. (2008) assumes a very limited situation, i.e., classification, discrete covariates, n(')→∞ and a maximum likelihood estimator. In this paper, we extend their method by modifying the weight. We prove that our proposal is safe in a significantly wide range of situations as long as n≤n('). Further, we give a geometrical interpretation of the proof of safety through the relationship with the above-mentioned statistical paradox. Finally, we show that the above proposal is asymptotically safe even when n(')<n by modifying the weight. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of these methods.},

@article{Cule2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technological developments have increased the feasibility of large scale genetic association studies. Densely typed genetic markers are obtained using SNP arrays, next-generation sequencing technologies and imputation. However, SNPs typed using these methods can be highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium among them, and standard multiple regression techniques fail with these data sets due to their high dimensionality and correlation structure. There has been increasing interest in using penalised regression in the analysis of high dimensional data. Ridge regression is one such penalised regression technique which does not perform variable selection, instead estimating a regression coefficient for each predictor variable. It is therefore desirable to obtain an estimate of the significance of each ridge regression coefficient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We develop and evaluate a test of significance for ridge regression coefficients. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that the performance of the test is comparable to that of a permutation test, with the advantage of a much-reduced computational cost. We introduce the p-value trace, a plot of the negative logarithm of the p-values of ridge regression coefficients with increasing shrinkage parameter, which enables the visualisation of the change in p-value of the regression coefficients with increasing penalisation. We apply the proposed method to a lung cancer case-control data set from EPIC, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed test is a useful alternative to a permutation test for the estimation of the significance of ridge regression coefficients, at a much-reduced computational cost. The p-value trace is an informative graphical tool for evaluating the results of a test of significance of ridge regression coefficients as the shrinkage parameter increases, and the proposed test makes its production computationally feasible.},

abstract = {At various machine learning conferences, at various times, there have been discussions arising from the inability to replicate the experimental results published in a paper. There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount.  I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two.  Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

The bounds generalise the margin-based bounds

theorem and leads to new representations
for loss and regret and a simple proof of the integral
representation of proper losses. We also
present a different formulation of a duality result
of Bregman divergences which leads to a simple
demonstration of the convexity of composite
losses using canonical link functions},

@inproceedings{Hoi2006,
abstract = {The goal of active learning is to select the most informative examples for manual labeling. Most of the previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting a single unlabeled example in each iteration. This could be ineﬃcient since the classiﬁcation model has to be retrained for every labeled example. In this paper, we present a framework for “batch mode active learning” that applies the Fisher information matrix to select a number of informative examples simultaneously. The key computational challenge is how to eﬃciently identify the subset of unlabeled examples that can result in the largest reduction in the Fisher information. To resolve this challenge, we propose an eﬃcient greedy algorithm that is based on the property of submodular functions. Our empirical studies with ﬁve UCI datasets and one realworld medical image classiﬁcation show that the proposed batch mode active learning algorithm is more eﬀective than the state-ofthe-art algorithms for active learning},

@article{Leek2007,
abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},
